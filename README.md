# Counter-App
So basically I've started my JS practice journey and this is one of the basic project and many more yet to come.

This is Counter App made by using HTML,CSS and JS.
Since It's a JS Practice Journey I would like brief about what all things I've used in this project.

I've used EVENT DELEGATION over here.
Basically Event Delegation means to handle events efficiently using patterns.
